## Swen - An Event Bus written in Swift

- [x] Typesafe events
- [x] Pass custom objects
- [x] Threadsafe
- [x] Sticky events
- [x] Fast and small

## Getting started

Swen is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Swen"
```

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+ / macOS 10.10+ / tvOS 9.0+ / watchOS 2.0+
- Xcode 8.1+
- Swift 3.0+

## Usage
```swift
import Swen

struct TestEvent: Event {
    let name: String
}

class TestViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillAppear(animated)
        //register for incoming events
        Swen<TestEvent>.register(self) { event in
            print(event.name)
        }
        //post event
        Swen.post(TestEvent(name: "Sixt"))
    }

    override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidDisappear(animated)
        //unregister from events
        Swen<TestEvent>.unregister(self)
    }

}
```

### Register on different threads
```swift
// Registers on the main thread
Swen<Event>.register(_ observer: AnyObject, handler: (_ event: Event) -> Void)

// Registers on background queue
Swen<Event>.registerOnBackground(_ observer: AnyObject, handler: (_ event: Event) -> Void)

// Registers the closure on a specific queue
Swen<Event>.register(_ observer: AnyObject, onQueue queue: OperationQueue, handler: (_ event: Event) -> Void)
```

### Sticky events
Sometimes events carry information that is not only important for that one moment but needs to be kept around longer. For these cases sticky events come in handy. They behave the same as normal events with two further additions. First you can query them by:

```swift
struct TestStickyEvent: StickyEvent {
    let name: String
}

print(Swen<TestStickyEvent>.sticky?.name)
```
***Important:*** The sticky property is optional, because the event may not be posted yet!

The second additions is that if you register for a sticky event and one was already posted before. It will immediately trigger the registered closure
```swift
class TestViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillAppear(animated)
        //post event
        Swen.post(TestStickyEvent(name: "Stick it"))

        //register for incoming events
        Swen<TestStickyEvent>.register(self) { event in
            print(event.name)
        }
    }

}
```

## Performance
One of the other main benefits of using Swen is the significant performance increase over NSNotificationCenter

| Performance Test                        | NSNotificationCenter   | SwiftBus   |
| ----------------------------------------|:----------------------:| ----------:|
| Perform 10ˆ6 Events to 1 receiver       | 6.54s                  | 2.61s      |
| Perform 10ˆ3 Events to 10ˆ3 receivers   | 14.42s                 | 11.15s     |
